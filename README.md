# AmazonTrackerExtension

## Description
This is a Google Extension that allows users to keep track of items which they wish to purchase at a lower price. This extension will keep track of the product's url, name, price and availability.  It will also allow users to check up on the item and will display the new price in green if the price drops and red if the price raises. 

## Features
- Allows users to visit any page on amazon.ca & amazon.com to add the item to the list
- Allows users to quickly open the product page of any item they have added
- Allows users to check up on their items and update the list with new information
- Allows users to favorite items, which will bring them to the top of the list
- Allows users to remove items, which removes the item from the extension

## Future Updates
- Changes in price and availability will be checked periodically, without opening a new tab, and alerts the user
- Have a settings button for the user to switch between different amazon sites to update the quick links
- Send the user an error message if the item added is undefined or if there is a port error
- Update the user interface
